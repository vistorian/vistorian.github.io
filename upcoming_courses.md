Are you performing network analysis or wanting to learn about network exploration using interactive visualisations? Do you have network data you want to visualise and explore? Are you thinking about collecting network data (e.g., from letters, social networks, language models, etc.) and want to learn about the potential of visual exploration? 

As part of our ongoing research on supporting network analysis and exploration through visualizations,  **the VisHub team at the University of Edinburgh [https://vishub.net](https://vishub.net) is running *a free 1-to-1 online coaching Program on network visualization***, to help you understand and perform visual exploration with your network data. This program will support participants through 1-to-1 sessions to support a flexible and self-regulated learning style. *Sessions will take place during February and mid of March 2023*.

## Who is this program for? 

You can join our program whether you are at any stage during your exploration process, and we are happy to help and discuss possible pathways how we can best help you: 
* if you don't have any data yet but want to learn about visual exploration 
* you have research goals but don’t know what data to collect
* have data and want to start exploring
* want to discuss your current exploration whether you have specific goal to achieve or not
* etc... 


## Program Goals

The goal of our program is to help you with your data collection, formatting, visual exploration as well as the planning of each of these stages. Things we will help you with during the individual sessions:
* Learning about the potentials of network visualization for your data
* Help define research questions related to network exploration 
* Help define network structures for your data
* Help learn interactive exploration features
* Help understand different kinds of data visualisations for networks

## Session Content

Sessions can walk you through (coach) you in all steps of network exploration process, including: 
1. **how to describe your data through concept maps/knowledge graphs** to understand how data attributes are related and found the basis of visual network exploration.
2. **how to use concept maps/knowledge graphs to create networks** , filter your data and explore your data starting from your research question and/or exploration goal.
3. **how to decide on which visualization(s) to explore** based on the data described in your concept map/knowledge graph and your research goal.
4. **how to overcome obstacles faced in the data formation process** through exploring different possible goal-based data transformation(s) and wrangling options (ex. Extracting nodes and links from historical documents).
5. **how to explore your data interactively** thhrough choosing among different exploration strategies whether on the data side or the visualization side.


We will use [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.net/), an online tool that provides interaction visualizations for networks: **node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, a timeline, and a map**. Each visualization provides a complementary view onto network data. This course will assist you in visual network exploration as well as in preparing your network data. The Vistorian offers a number of [visualizations](https://vistorian.github.io/visualizations.html) that can assist you in exploring data from various backgrounds such as historical, social, biological, business data and much more.

## Slack Channel

We invite you to The Vistorian slack channel for questions, open discussions on the Vistorian and on how can we use exploratory and interactive visualizations, and updates, please join us on : <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/vistorian/shared_invite/zt-zo1w94tf-dkrbkqsRQqOTxavI3R~m_w" target="_blank" >The Vistorian Slack Channel</a> 

# FAQs

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
Please refer to the ethics forms approved by the ethics committee at University of Edinburgh for a detailed description on how we handle your data. You can find detailed description of the ethics forms here:
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EQkbeqU1UsZKtMq1BrugeFIBwBllQyMOWdFHqjD9Xz1Thg?e=aPkLi6">Participant Consent Form</a>
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/ETClS1lSkXNAvOoHxoGjTZsB7OgEGnjVscxDYoSLaBWN3A?e=mXMKP7">Participant Information Sheet</a>

### If we do not download software, does that mean The Vistorian will hold and have access to our data?
The Vistorian stores all of your data on the user's own machine. As The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. 

### Can The Vistorian handle data held in a GEDCOM file?
The current version does not support GEDCOM files. This feature might be added in the near future, but as a workaround GEDCOM files can be converted to CSV and used with the Vistorian.

### Can I join the course without my own dataset? Will you have a demo dataset to play with? As I minted to collect network data soon but would like to see what visualization I can do.
Yes, a demo dataset shall be provided to participants who do not have their own dataset. Priority is for those who have their own dataset to work on, however we will keep in consideration participants with/without datasets.

### Is it possible to work on a view of 1000 links of a larger graph or are there efficiency limitations elsewhere? E.g loading the graph and running algorithms on it.
The Vistorian can handle up to 5000 links graphs, what matters actually is the number of links. However, it might degrade the interactivity and response as the graph size goes up to such a number. Due the fact that all graph data is stored on the user’s machine (browser’s local storage) which has a limited space.
