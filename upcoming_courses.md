**The Vistorian team is running a *series of free coaching sessions* on network visualization, tailored to your individual needs. These coaching sessions are aimed at anyone interested in learning or advancing their network visualization skills, while supporting a flexible and self-regulated learning style.**

You can join our coaching sessions at any stage during your exploration process, including: 
* If you don't have any data yet but want to learn about visual exploration 
* Have data and want to start exploring
* Want to discuss your current exploration whether you have specific goal to achieve or not
* You have research goals but don’t know what data to collect
* Etc... 

To get the best out of each session, we have designed _4 themes where you can choose from what suits your purpose, to guide the flow of each session_:  
* Network Visual Exploration for Concept & Tool Learners (neither data nor goals exist)
* Network Visual Exploration for Data Collectors (with research goals/question but no data yet) 
* Network Visual Exploration for Guided Exploration (both research goals/question and data exist)  
* Network Visual Exploration for Free-Form Exploration (data exist but with no research goals/question) 

For further details about each theme session please [scroll down here](#sessions-themes-description).

In each individual 1-1 sessions, we will discuss:
* your individual skills and needs
* discuss approaches, strategies, and tools, and 
* reflect on your current exploration process and findings. 

**Coaching sessions** are:
* free of charge,
* open to everyone (with a limit of 15 people), 
* online (using Teams/Zoom)
* Will make use of a range of supporting material, such as tutorials, videos, comics,
* As well as smaller activities you can do by yourself.

In addition to individual 1-1 coaching sessions, we offer **public Engagement sessions**. 
An engagement session :
* Is scheduled once a week each Thursday (4-5) pm UK time through Zoom click here for meeting link. ​
* Contains a 10-15 minutes ice-breaker introduction or activity 
* Aims at discussing general issues around network visualization 
* Provide time for general Q&A 
* Provide time to network and learn about other participants' projects

Sessions are held during _February and March_ during first piloting phases. 


## Session Content

Sessions can walk you through (coach) you in all steps of network exploration process, including: 
1. **how to describe your data through concept maps/knowledge graphs** to understand how data attributes are related and found the bases of visual network exploration.
2. **how to use concept maps/knowledge graphs to create networks** , filter your data and explore your data starting from your research question or exploration goal.
3. **how to decide on which visualization(s) to explore** based on the data described in your concept map/knowledge graph and your research goal.
4. **how to overcome obstacles faced in the data formation process** through exploring different possible goal-based data transformation and wrangling option.
5. **how to explore your data interactively** through choosing among different exploration strategies whether on the data side or the visualization side.


We will use [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.net/), an online tool that provides interaction visualizations for networks: **node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, a timeline, and a map**. Each visualization provides a complementary view onto network data. This course will assist you in visual network exploration as well as in preparing your network data.

## Sessions Themes Description

### Network Visual Exploration for _Concept & Tool Learners_ Session: 

*Targeted Audience:* newcomers and participants who are intrested in learning the concept of network visual exploration or the Vistorian as a tool. Such participants are expected to have neither datasets nor research goals.

The session covers the following topics:
* What is networks visual exploration?
* How to start with network visual exploration?
    * starting with a demo example.
    * sketching your concept map/knowledge graph to understand the underlaying data structure.
    * exploring possible different questions to answer from a given dataset with/out a research goal or a question.
* How to explore data interactively by choosing among possible different visualizations?

### Network Visual Exploration for _Data Collectors_ Session:

*Targeted Audience:* participants with a limited background in networks visual exploration and are intrested in knowing how to collect data for their own research. Their research goals and questions should be a bit in a shape to use them in knowing what data to collect through the session. Such participants are expected to have research goal(s)/question(s) but without collected data so far.

The session covers the following topics:
* how to start from my research question or goal to describe the expected data to collect?
* creating your network and populating it with dummy data to test.
* understanding which visualization(s) to explore and how based on your described data and research goals.


### Network Visual Exploration for _Guided Exploration_ Session:

The session covers the following topics:
* how to describe their data using concept maps/knowledge graphs?
* how to choose which data that answers their question(s) and how?
* which visualization(s) serves their exploration purposes the best?

### Network Visual Exploration for _Free-Form Exploration_ Session:

*Targeted Audience:* participants who are intrested in knowing different aspects of visual network exploration and different strategies. Such participants are expected to have neither dataset(s) but with no specific research goals.

The session covers the following topics:

# FAQs

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
Please refer to the ethics forms approved by the ethics committee at University of Edinburgh for a detailed description on how we handle your data. You can find detailed description of the ethics forms here:
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EQkbeqU1UsZKtMq1BrugeFIBwBllQyMOWdFHqjD9Xz1Thg?e=aPkLi6">Participant Consent Form</a>
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EUQscy2FydpHo_Dh2cCb9LgBPS7NMqcmbzxFKC9kqGgeeg?e=nEkUQE">Participant Information Sheet</a>

### If we do not download software, does that mean The Vistorian will hold and have access to our data?
The Vistorian stores all of your data on the user's own machine. As The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. 

### Can The Vistorian handle data held in a GEDCOM file?
The current version does not support GEDCOM files. This feature might be added in the near future, but as a workaround GEDCOM files can be converted to CSV and used with the Vistorian.

### Can I join the course without my own dataset? Will you have a demo dataset to play with? As I minted to collect network data soon but would like to see what visualization I can do.
Yes, a demo dataset shall be provided to participants who do not have their own dataset. Priority is for those who have their own dataset to work on, however we will keep in consideration participants with/without datasets.

### Is it possible to work on a view of 1000 links of a larger graph or are there efficiency limitations elsewhere? E.g loading the graph and running algorithms on it.
The Vistorian can handle up to 5000 links graphs, what matters actually is the number of links. However, it might degrade the interactivity and response as the graph size goes up to such a number. Due the fact that all graph data is stored on the user’s machine (browser’s local storage) which has a limited space.
