**The Vistorian team is running a *free, hands-on online course* that teaches how to form and create your network data for visual exploration purposes. The sessions will cover in addition the basics of exploring temporal, geographical, and multivariate network data (e.g., social networks) through interactive network visualizations.**
Exploratory network analysis is suitable for those working or planning to work with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods research, at any stage of their research process.

We will use [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.net/), an online tool that provides interaction visualizations for networks: **node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, a timeline, and a map**. Each visualization provides a complementary view onto network data. This course will assist you in visual network exploration as well as in preparing your network data.

## Course Structure

This course offers **4 different sessions of 2-hours each** where partcipants can freely choose from among which to attend based on their own research needs. Those sessions are opend for all enrolled participants at the same time. Following each session, **an indivdual 1-to-1 sessions** will be offered to each participant to assist them in reaching their own goal, overcome obstacles faced through the data formation process, and answer their questions. The course may require potentially more time at home to prepare and work with your data. 

During the course, you will learn to
1. **how to describe your data through concept maps/knowledge graphs** to understand how data attributes are related and found the bases of visual network exploration.
2. **how to use concept maps/knowledge graphs to create networks** , filter your data and explore you data starting from your research question or exploration goal.
3. **how to decide on which visualization(s) to explore** based on the data described in your concept map/knowledge graph and your research goal.
4. **how to overcome obstacles faced in the data formation process** through exploring different possible goal-based data transformation and wrangling option.
5. **how to explore your data interactively** through choosing among different exploration strategies whether on the data side or the visualization side.

The course combines **brief lectures** with **hands-on activities**, **discussions**, **individual support**, and networking possibilities. The course includes case-studies and discussions about exploratory network research.

## Info Sessions

We run 2 **open info sessions** on 
* **Friday 27th January 2023 (4-5pm UK)**, and a repetition on 
* **Monday 30th January 2023 (5-6pm UK)**.
Both sessions are the same and will walk you throught the course, demo the Vistorian, and give you the opportunity to meet us and discuss questions before signing up. **[Join an info session on zoom](https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/87942430223)**. **Passcode: 0VKrju4z** .



## Course Schedule and Meeting Link

### Session 1 : Network Visual Exploration for Concept & Tool Learners _1st Feb 2023_: 

*Targeted Audience:* newcomers and participants who are intrested in learning the concept of network visual exploration or the Vistorian as a tool. Such participants are expected to have neither datasets nor research goals.

The session covers the following topics:
* What is networks visual exploration?
* How to start with network visual exploration?
    * starting with a demo example.
    * sketching your concept map/knowledge graph to understand the underlaying data structure.
    * exploring possible different questions to answer from a given dataset with/out a research goal or a question.
* How to explore data interactively by choosing among possible different visualizations?

### Session 2 : Network Visual Exploration for Data Collectors _8th Feb 2023_:

*Targeted Audience:* participants with a limited background in networks visual exploration and are intrested in knowing how to collect data for their own research. Their research goals and questions should be a bit in a shape to use them in knowing what data to collect through the session. Such participants are expected to have research goal(s)/question(s) but without collected data so far.

The session covers the following topics:
* how to start from my research question or goal to describe the expected data to collect?
* creating your network and populating it with dummy data to test.
* understanding which visualization(s) to explore and how based on your described data and research goals.


### Session 3 : Network Visual Exploration for Guided Exploration _15th Feb 2023_:

*Targeted Audience:*  participants who have their data ready along with research goals and are intrested in exploring different aspects of their networks. Such participants are expected to have both dataset(s) and clear research goals.

The session covers the following topics:
* how to describe their data using concept maps/knowledge graphs?
* how to choose which data that answers their question(s) and how?
* which visualization(s) serves their exploration purposes the best?

### Session 4 : Network Visual Exploration for Free-Form Exploration _22nd Feb 2023_:

*Targeted Audience:* participants who are intrested in knowing different aspects of visual network exploration and different strategies. Such participants are expected to have neither dataset(s) but with no specific research goals.

The session covers the following topics:
* how to describe my data using concept maps/knowedgle graph?
* what are the possible research questions to investigate?
* what are the possible strategies to explore a network?
* What are the possible data transformations and wrangling options to choose from?

## Course Prerequisites and Requirements

* **No technical or programming skills** are required. The course is primarily tailored towards scholars in the humanities and those starting to explore their network data.
* **No pre-knowledge in network analysis** of terminology is required. We start with the very basics and introduce all terminology necessary for the course. 
* **We expect participants to be working with their own network** data during the course as the course will help you working with that dataset. If you do not have your own dataset, we can provide you with demo data.
* Your **data should not be too large** as any visualization of large data sets is challenging in itself. An ideal size for the course is up to 500 links in your network. Ideally, your networks has fewer links to make best use of the activities and visualizations.
* **Your dataset can contain any of the following aspects:**
    * _Geographic information_ (such as place names). No coordinates are required. 
    * _Temporal information_ such as the precise time a relationship is active (e.g., a day) or their start and end date. 
    * _Multiple links between the same two two nodes_ (such as individual letters sent between two people
    * _Directed links_ (such as a letter send from person A to person B) or undirected links
    * _Weighted links_ (such as strength of a social relationship)
    * _Different types of links_ (such as different types of social relationships) 
    * _Different types of nodes_.
* **Software requirements:** 
    * No specific visualization software needs to be installed for this course. 
    * You need a web browser. Note that none of your data will be transmitted to any of our servers. Your data stays locally in your browser.
    * You also need software that allows you to edit tables such as Excel or spreadsheets in Google Drive. 

## Key Information

* The course is **free of charge and open to everybody**. You do not have to be based in the UK. 
* We have a **limited number of 20 places**. Priority will be given to those who bring their own dataset as the course benefits will be highest (even if your data are not fully prepared and formatted).
* For **4 weeks, we meet every Wednesday from 3pm to 5pm (UK time)**.
* Each of these sessions consists of some theoretical explanations (lasting roughly 30 minutes), some hands-on activities, and time for discussion.  
* The course runs online, **using Zoom** (link to be provided)
* We encourage everyone to **bring their own data**.
* We **will explain how to format your data** if you want to use your own data in the subsequent sessions.
* If you do not have own data at the moment, we can provide you with demo data. However, you will get the most out of this course if you bring own data. 
* After each sessions, **you can start working on your own data**  prior to the 1-to-1 session. This enables us to make use of individualled meetings to discuss any obstacls faced and assist you to reach your goal t. We suggest reserving the necessary time for such task before committing to the course as the course has a limited number of places and we want every participant to take full advantage of the course. The time you want to allocate will depend on what it takes you to properly format your data within a table such as Excel.

## What to Prepare Before the Course? 

* You should have a dataset that you want to visualize. Ideally, this data set is already formatted in some machine readable format such as a table in Excel or a CSV file. However, this is not a requirement as we will teach you how to format your data.
* We would ask each participant to prepare **a 3 mintues pitch to introduce themselves** to the other participants and the course organisers. Please prepare around 3 slides with the following information
  * Your general background and research
  * The data set you are working with (we acknowledge that you may not want to disclose too much information about this. In that case, keep this part short and high level)
  * Any challenges you have faced working with the data set (e.g., previous tools you have used) and your specific research questions.

# FAQs

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
Please refer to the ethics forms approved by the ethics committee at University of Edinburgh for a detailed description on how we handle your data. You can find detailed description of the ethics forms here:
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EQkbeqU1UsZKtMq1BrugeFIBwBllQyMOWdFHqjD9Xz1Thg?e=aPkLi6">Participant Consent Form</a>
* <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EUQscy2FydpHo_Dh2cCb9LgBPS7NMqcmbzxFKC9kqGgeeg?e=nEkUQE">Participant Information Sheet</a>

### If we do not download software, does that mean The Vistorian will hold and have access to our data?
The Vistorian stores all of your data on the user's own machine. As The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. 

### Can The Vistorian handle data held in a GEDCOM file?
The current version does not support GEDCOM files. This feature might be added in the near future, but as a workaround GEDCOM files can be converted to CSV and used with the Vistorian.

### Can I join the course without my own dataset? Will you have a demo dataset to play with? As I minted to collect network data soon but would like to see what visualization I can do.
Yes, a demo dataset shall be provided to participants who do not have their own dataset. Priority is for those who have their own dataset to work on, however we will keep in consideration participants with/without datasets.

### Is it possible to work on a view of 1000 links of a larger graph or are there efficiency limitations elsewhere? E.g loading the graph and running algorithms on it.
The Vistorian can handle up to 5000 links graphs, what matters actually is the number of links. However, it might degrade the interactivity and response as the graph size goes up to such a number. Due the fact that all graph data is stored on the user’s machine (browser’s local storage) which has a limited space.
