## Developing for the Vistorian

<!-- The Vistorian has a set of repositories and has undergone different versions. This document will help you getting to grips with how you can start helping with the development of the Vistorian. 

### Highlevel structure

The Vistorian is modular, in that is has
* A __libary `networkcube.js`__ which contains core functionality on loading and querying dynamic networks. This is managed by it's own repository: [Vistorian-core](https://github.com/networkcube/vistorian-core).
* A __set of visualizations__, which query network data from `networkcube.js` and visualize them. Each visualization is its own project and independent from any other visualization. 
* A __web-application, _Vistorian_,__ that manages uploading data and creates a website with differnt visualizations. -->
