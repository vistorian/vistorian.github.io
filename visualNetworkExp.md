In this page you can find material related to our course on **Visual Exploration of Networks**. For full details about the course, please visit the course's [info page](/networkexploration.md).

**Course Goals**
1. Structure your network data and prepare it for visualization with the Vistorian.
2. Define goals of your exploration and what you aim to learn about your network data using visualizations.
3. Know a range of network visualizations, through theory and hands-on use.
4. Use different types of interactive visualizations to explore your data.
 

## Part (1): Network Data Prepration
In this part we introduce data prepration for network creation. This includes what considerations and decisions you need to take while preparing your network's data.

### (1)Network Data Prepration

In the first session we introduce the following concepts:
* Dataset selected for Hands-on Activities
* Ethics & Data Privacy
* What is a Network?
* What is Network Exploration?
* Role of Visualizations in Network Exploration
* Sketching your network
* Network Concept Map
* Creating Node and/or Link Tables
* How can you format your network data?

### (2)Extra Session on Network Data Prepration

In the second session we emphasize more how to prepare your network data through more examples. The session's outline is as following:
* Discussion on Challenges Faced from Concept Map and Network Tables  
* Examples on Company Network
* Re-practice Activities on Creating Network Concept Maps & Tables

### (3)Data Shaping Techniques and Challenges

In the third session we discuss how specify and decide on additional attributes such as link weight. Also, we discuss how can you take other decisions while preparing your data on other aspects based on your research goal and dataset context. This session's outline is:
* Discussion on Challenges Faced from Concept Map and Network Tables  
* Examples on Visual Network Exploration
* Ensuring Consistency of your Data
* Common Challenges in Network Visualizations
* Assistive Techniques in Shaping your Data

## Part (2): Visual Network Exploration

In this part we start disucssing how to explore your network visually through different network visualizations. This includes how to understand visual encodings, explore patterns, and other stratigies in visual exploration (e.g. temporal exploration).

### (4) Exploring with Node-link diagrams

In the fourth session we introduce _Network Visual Exploration_ as a concept. Then we start describing how can we visually explore networks using node-link diagrams, what to consider when exploring them and what kind of questions to ask while exploring such diagrams. This session's outline is as following:
* What is visual network exploration? 
* How to close-reading a network diagram? (visual patterns)
* Asking questions to your data (questions + hypotheses)
* Performing interactive exploration (strategies)

### (5)Exploring with Adjacency Matrix

In the fifth session we introduce how to explore network data using adjacency matrix. This includes how they are created, how to read their visual encodings and what kind of patterns an analyst can find and how to interpret. The outline of this session is as following:
* Sparse vs. Dense Networks
* What is an Adjacency Matrix? 
* Visual Encodings
* Visual Patterns
* Demo

### (6)Exploring with Timeline, Map, and Coordinated View

In the sixth sessions we cover two additional visualizations (Timeline and Map) in addition to the coordinated view. The outline of this session is as following:

* Timeline Visualization
* Maps
* Demo 
* Group Exercise 
* Questions & Discussion
